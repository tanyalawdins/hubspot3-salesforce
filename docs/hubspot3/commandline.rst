Commandline
===========

The hubspot3 client comes with an optional commandline interface that makes it easy to use the client's features without
necessarily importing it within a Python project.

Installation
------------

To use the commandline interface you will have to install an additional Python requirement:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install hubspot3[cli]

Usage
-----

After the installation you can use the client with the ``hubspot3`` command, e.g. to display the help:

.. code-block:: bash

    hubspot3 --help

This will display all arguments for the general usage of the commandline client, like the API key (or a config file,
see below). Please take a look into the constructor of the ``hubspot3.Hubspot3`` class for the list of provided
arguments.

By just calling ``hubspot3`` you will get a list of all featured APIs that are available, e.g.:

.. code-block:: bash

    huspot3

    Usage:       hubspot3 -
                 hubspot3 - blog
                 hubspot3 - blog-comments
                 hubspot3 - broadcast
    [...]

By attaching the API name you can access the specific API endpoints:

.. code-block:: bash

    hubspot3 deals

    Usage:       hubspot3 deals
                 hubspot3 deals associate
                 hubspot3 deals create
                 hubspot3 deals get
    [...]

Each API method has it's own documentation and the help can be displayed like this:

.. code-block:: bash

    hubspot3 deals get -- --help

    [...]
    Docstring:   Supported ARGS/KWARGS are:
    DEAL_ID [--OPTIONS ...]
    --deal-id DEAL_ID [--OPTIONS ...]
    [...]

This will display the methods parameter list and how to pass them to the specific API endpoint, in this case you can
get the deal information for a specific deal with:

.. code-block:: bash

    hubspot3 --api-key xxxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxx-xxxx-xxxxx deals get --deal-id 100

.. note::

    You will notice the leading ``--`` in front of the ``--help`` parameter. Hubspot3 uses the ``python-fire`` library
    to generate a dynamic commandline interface for all API clients. If you don't add the ``--`` the help command will
    be passed as an argument API method instead of invoking Fire's help output, so we have to set it. Generally
    speaking, the arguments for the API method call need to be separated from general CLI arguments using ``--``.

Configuration file
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Instead of providing the API key (``--api-key``) or other settings (like ``--client-id`` or ``--timeout``) as
parameters you can also create a local JSON file, that contains all the settings you want to pass to the client:

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "api_key": "xxxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxx-xxxx-xxxxx",
        "timeout": 60
    }

Simply call the hubspot client with the ``--config`` parameter:

.. code-block:: bash

    hubspot3 --config config.json

Using ``stdin`` for parameters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Some of the data you want to pass to the hubspot3 may be sensitive or just too much to pass it as a regular
parameter. Therefore you can simply pass data from ``stdin`` to the client so that the data can be streamed and won't
occur in your shell history. To do so just use the token ``__stdin__`` for one of your parameters:

.. code-block:: bash

    hubspot3 --config config.json \
       contacts update --contact_id 451 \
       --data "__stdin__" < contact_data.json

In this case ``contact_data.json`` is a JSON file that contains the contacts data to update:

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "properties": [
            {
                "property": "firstname",
                "value": "Adrian"
            },
            {
                "property": "lastname",
                "value": "Mott"
            }
        ]
    }

Extending the APIs
------------------

There is one specialty in the way python-fire discovers the API clients: it will parse all classes that are derived
from ``BaseClient`` and are provided as a property within the ``hubspot3.Hubspot3`` class. Within these API clients
python-fire will look for public methods and provide them as a commandline API endpoint.

If you want to suppress python-fire to discover certain public methods (e.g. because the method will instantly make a
call to Hubspot or the method doesn't reflect an API endpoint) you can hide that method by extending
the ``__main__.Hubspot3CLIWrapper.IGNORED_PROPERTIES`` tuple within ``hubspot3.__main__.py``:

.. code-block:: python

    class Hubspot3CLIWrapper(object):

        IGNORED_PROPERTIES = ('me', 'usage_limits', 'my_method_to_hide')
