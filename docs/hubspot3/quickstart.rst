Quickstart
==========

This document presents a brief, high-level overview of hubspot3's primary features.

hubspot3 is a python wrapper around HubSpot's APIs, for python 3.

.. note::
    Be aware that this uses the HubSpot API directly, so you are subject to all of the `guidelines that HubSpot has in place <https://developers.hubspot.com/apps/api_guidelines>`_.

At the time of writing, HubSpot has the following limits in place for API requests:

- 10 requests per second
- 40,000 requests per day. This daily limit resets at midnight based on the time zone setting of the HubSpot account

Installation
------------

.. code-block:: bash

    # install hubspot3
    pip install hubspot3


Basic Usage
-----------

.. code-block:: python

   from hubspot3 import Hubspot3

   API_KEY = "your-api-key"

   client = Hubspot3(api_key=API_KEY)

   # all of the clients are accessible as attributes of the main Hubspot3 Client
   contact = client.contacts.get_contact_by_email('testingapis@hubspot.com')
   contact_id = contact['vid']

   all_companies = client.companies.get_all()

   # new usage limit functionality - keep track of your API calls
   client.usage_limit
   # <Hubspot3UsageLimits: 28937/1000000 (0.028937%) [reset in 22157s, cached for 299s]>

   client.usage_limit.calls_remaining
   # 971063


Individual Clients
------------------

.. code-block:: python

   from hubspot3.companies import CompaniesClient

   API_KEY = "your-api-key"

   client = CompaniesClient(api_key=API_KEY)

   for company in client.get_all():
       print(company)

Passing Params
--------------

.. code-block:: python

   import json
   from hubspot3.deals import DealsClient

   deal_id = "12345"
   API_KEY = "your_api_key"

   deals_client = DealsClient(api_key=API_KEY)

   params = {
       "includePropertyVersions": "true"
   }  # Note values are camelCase as they appear in the Hubspot Documentation!

   deal_data = deals_client.get(deal_id, params=params)
   print(json.dumps(deal_data))
